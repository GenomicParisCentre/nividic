    <p>Nividic is a framework for DNA microarray analysis. This project is devide in three main components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>om</b> for the object model to represent biological data.</li>
      <li><b>platform</b> for the framework to manipulate workflows of biological data.</li>
      <li><b>utils</b> for common utility classes.</li>
    </ul>

    <!--<section name="History">

    <p>The Nividic was born as the Romde project in the <a href="http://www-dsv.cea.fr/content/cea/d_dep/d_drr/d_sgf/">Service de Génomique Fonctionnelle (SGF)</a> at the <a href="http://www.cea.fr">Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique</a> as C++ library. Then in 2004, the École Normale Supérieure  microarray platform and the SGF decide to collaborate for rewriting from scratch the project in Java. This project is now available on most platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOs X...) and our goal is to link this library with main projects use for microarray data analysis and exchange such R and MAGE-OM.</p>
